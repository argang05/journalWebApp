A "journal in press" refers to a research article that has been accepted for publication
in a scholarly journal but has not yet been officially published, meaning it is currently
undergoing the final formatting and production stages before being released in a specific
issue, and therefore may not have complete publication details like volume, issue, or page
numbers assigned yet
